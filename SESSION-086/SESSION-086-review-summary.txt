Session 086 Review Summary
===========================

Session 086 contains 3 Python scripts focused on closures and implicit state saving.
All scripts ran successfully with correct output.


File-by-file review:

01-implicit-state-saving-revision.py
--------------------------------------
Demonstrates the core closure concept: when outer() returns inner, the nested
function retains access to outer()'s local variable N even after outer() has
finished executing. Two patterns are shown - calling inner() inside outer()
(Pattern 1), vs. returning it for later use (Pattern 2). Both print
inner():N: 100.

Output:
  inner():N: 100
  inner():N: 100
  inner():N: 100


02-FunctionFactory.py
--------------------------------------
A practical application of closures as a factory pattern.
PowerFunctionFactory(N) creates specialized power functions by closing over N.

Output:
  mySquareFunction(2): 4
  myCubeFunction(2): 8
  myRaisedToSevenFunction(2): 128


03-implicit-state-vs-explicit-state.py
--------------------------------------
Contrasts two state-management approaches: a class-based approach (commented out)
using self.N vs. nested functions using nonlocal N. The nested-function version
returns a (getn, setn) tuple, effectively mimicking getter/setter methods.
Output confirms correct state transitions: 100 -> 200 -> 500.

Output:
  NESTED DEF STATEMENT
  100
  200
  500


All code is correct, runs without errors, and produces the expected output.
No issues found.
