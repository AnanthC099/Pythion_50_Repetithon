    -   Classification of built in data types: 
            -   Atomic - bool int float 
            -   container - sequential, associative, neither 
            -   list, tuple, str, dict, set 
            -   deep study of methods of all built in types

        -   How to add a class method 

        REMAINING -> Operator overloading (entire), Inheritance (entire), Exception Handling (entire)

-   Truely advanced Python topics 
        -   ALL REMAINING (iterator, context management protocol, decorator, attribute management, meta-class)

-   Application development 
    -   file handling, directory handling, tkinter - Done 
    -   remaining -> process, thread, regular expression, db connectivity 
    -   ML/DS -> entire coding part (basic concepts are over)
