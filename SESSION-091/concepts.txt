SESSION-091: Concepts Taught
=============================

This session focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) applied to
geometric modeling of Quadrilaterals, taught across two progressive files.


01-Quadrilateral.py
-------------------
Concept: Basic Class Design with Primitive Attributes

- Defining a class (Quadrilateral) with an __init__ constructor.
- Using type hints in method signatures (init_s1:float, -> float).
- Input validation inside the constructor:
    - Type checking: ensuring all sides are int or float.
    - Value checking: ensuring all sides are positive.
    - Geometric validity: verifying that the sum of any three sides
      is greater than the fourth (quadrilateral inequality).
- Raising built-in exceptions (TypeError, ValueError) for invalid input.
- Instance attributes: storing data on self (self.s1, self.s2, etc.).
- Instance methods:
    - perimeter(): summing the four sides.
    - area(): using Brahmagupta's formula (generalized for a cyclic
      quadrilateral) with the semi-perimeter.
- Creating an object and calling its methods from client-side code.


02-Quadrilateral.py
-------------------
Concept: Object Composition (Using One Class Inside Another)

- Defining a helper class (Point2D) to represent a 2D coordinate.
    - Constructor with type validation.
    - distance() method using the Euclidean distance formula.
    - show() method for displaying coordinates.
- Building the Quadrilateral class using Point2D objects as attributes
  instead of raw numeric sides. This demonstrates composition -- a
  Quadrilateral "has-a" Point2D at each vertex.
- Automatically computing side lengths from Point2D vertices inside
  the constructor using Point2D.distance().
- Same validation patterns as File 01 (type checking, value checking,
  geometric inequality), but now operating on derived side lengths.
- Demonstrates how composition leads to cleaner, more modular design:
  the client creates Point2D objects first, then passes them to
  Quadrilateral, keeping concerns separated.
- Inline comments showing the equivalent explicit constructor call
  vs. using pre-created variables.


Overall Session Theme
---------------------
Progression from a simple class with primitive parameters to a composed
class that builds on another class, illustrating how real-world objects
can be modeled by combining smaller, reusable components.
