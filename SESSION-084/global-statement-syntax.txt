GENERAL SYTAX: 
    - global variable_name 
    - global v1, v2, ...., vn   # comma separated list of multiple variable names 
    - global is a keyword as well as statement 

CONSTRAINTS: 
    - global statement must be written inside function definition that it must be a part 
      body of def statement. In all other places it will either generate syntax error 
      or will have no effect ! 

DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIOUR: 
    - When you declare a variable 'global' using global statement inside some function 
    then it is an order given to Python to treat all references to that variable 
    (RHS or LHS) in that function by considering it a global variable 

    In more technical terms, all references to a variable qualified by keyword global 
    in a function are bound to global symbol table overriding usual LHS treatment 
    or RHS treatment (LEGB rule)
