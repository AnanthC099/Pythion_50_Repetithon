SESSION-092: Concepts Taught
=============================

This session continues Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with two new
geometric/mathematical classes, emphasizing composition, richer method
design, and rigorous client-side testing.


01-Triangle.py
--------------
Concept: Class Composition, Classification Logic, and Boundary Testing

- Reuses the Point2D helper class (same as SESSION-091, File 02) to
  represent vertices, reinforcing the composition pattern.
- Defines a Triangle class that accepts three Point2D objects.
    - Constructor computes side lengths automatically via
      Point2D.distance().
    - Validates geometric feasibility using the triangle inequality
      (sum of any two sides must exceed the third).
- Instance methods:
    - perimeter(): sum of the three sides.
    - area(): Heron's formula using the semi-perimeter.
    - triangle_type(): classifies the triangle as Equilateral, Isosceles,
      or Scalene by comparing side lengths.
- Use of math.isclose() for floating-point comparison, teaching that
  direct equality (==) is unreliable for floats due to precision errors.
- Comprehensive client-side testing:
    - Normal cases: Scalene, Equilateral, Isosceles, and Right triangles.
    - Boundary/edge cases tested with try-except blocks:
        - Collinear points (degenerate triangle).
        - Wrong type passed as a vertex.
        - Duplicate (coincident) points.
  This demonstrates defensive programming and the importance of writing
  test cases that cover both valid and invalid inputs.


02-Vector3D.py
--------------
Concept: Modeling Mathematical Objects (Vectors) with OOP

- Defines a Vector3D class representing a positional vector in 3D
  Euclidean space with components (x, y, z).
- Constructor with type validation (int/float only).
- Rich set of vector operation methods:
    - add(): vector addition, returns a new Vector3D.
    - subtract(): vector subtraction, returns a new Vector3D.
    - mod(): magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the vector.
    - normalize(): returns the unit vector (vector / its magnitude).
      Raises ValueError for the zero vector (undefined direction).
    - dot(): scalar (dot) product of two vectors.
    - cross(): vector (cross) product of two vectors, computed using
      the determinant formula (component-wise expansion).
    - show(): displays the vector in i, j, k notation.
- Each method that operates on two vectors validates the type of both
  operands, reinforcing input validation practices.
- Client-side testing demonstrates:
    - Basic operations: addition, subtraction, magnitude, normalization.
    - Verification of mathematical properties:
        - The normalized vector has magnitude 1.
        - The cross product is perpendicular to both input vectors
          (verified by checking dot products equal zero).
    - Standard basis vector identities: i x j = k, j x k = i, k x i = j.
    - Boundary cases:
        - Zero vector normalization (should raise ValueError).
        - Non-numeric input (should raise TypeError).


Overall Session Theme
---------------------
Building classes that model well-known mathematical objects (Triangle and
Vector3D), with emphasis on:
  1. Composition (Triangle built from Point2D objects).
  2. Returning new objects from methods (immutable operation style).
  3. Floating-point comparison with math.isclose().
  4. Thorough client-side testing including boundary and edge cases.
  5. Mathematical verification of computed results (e.g., cross product
     perpendicularity, unit vector magnitude).
