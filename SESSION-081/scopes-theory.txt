Under Python programming language, following four entities have their own scope 
i.e. have their own symbol table 
1) Module 
2) Function 
3) Class 
4) Object 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike C++ Python programming language does not create a scope for every block. 
In C++ we call it as a block-level scoping. Python programming language has a block 
structure but does not have block level scoping. 
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you create a new Python source file, Python considers that you have created a 
new module whose name is equal to source file name without .py prefix. 
For example, if you create a Python source file, test.py then Python considers 
that you have created a module named 'test'. 

When a module is created (i.e. when you save a .py file) one scope automatically comes 
into picture -> a global scope aka module scope. 

As explained above, EVERY BLOCK != NEW SCOPE IN PYTHON. 

Only two block statements can introduct a new scope. 
1) def statement 
2) class statement 

Rest of the block statements 
1) if statement 
2) if-else statement 
3) if-elif-else statement 
4) for statement 
5) while statement 
6) for-else statement 
7) while-else statement 
8) try-except statement 
9) try-except-else statement 
10) try-except-finally statement 
11) try-except-else-finally statement 
12) with statement 

DO NOT INTRODUCE NEW SCOPE IN A FILE. 

xyz.py

for x in [10, 20, 30, 40]: 
    for y in (100, 200, 300, 400): 
        z = x + y   # Even though z is defined at indentation level 2 and not 0
                    # z will be placed in a global symbol table 

class T1: 
    BODY 

class T2: 
    BODY 




class T10: 
    BODY 

def f1(): 
    BODY 

def f2(): 
    def g(): 
        def h():
            try: 
                for x in L: 
                    for y in L: 
                        # do something with x and y
            except: 
                BODY 

def f3(): 
    BODY
