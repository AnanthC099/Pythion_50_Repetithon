Session 085 Review Summary
===========================

Session 085 contains 2 Python scripts introducing the concept of returning
functions as data objects, leading into closures and implicit state saving.
All scripts ran successfully with correct output.


File-by-file review:

01-Returning-Function-As-If-It-Were-A-Data-Object.py
--------------------------------------
Demonstrates that functions in Python are first-class objects. outer() defines
inner() and returns it (without calling it). The returned function object is
assigned to global variable X. type() and id() calls confirm that X and inner
reference the same function object. Calling X() then executes inner().

Output:
  outer():type(inner): <class 'function'>
  outer():id(inner): <memory address>
  global():type(X): <class 'function'>
  global():id(X): <memory address>
  global():Putting call operator on global variable X
  inner():Function entered
  inner():Function leaving
  global():End of program


02-Implicit-State-Saving-Prep.py
--------------------------------------
Builds on script 01 by adding a local variable num = 500 inside outer(). When
outer() returns inner and inner is later called via X(), inner still has access
to num despite outer() having finished execution. This demonstrates the
foundation of closures: the inner function captures the enclosing scope's
variable. The IDLE log confirms locals() inside inner includes {'num': 500}.

Output:
  outer():type(inner): <class 'function'>
  outer():id(inner): <memory address>
  global():type(X): <class 'function'>
  global():id(X): <memory address>
  global():Putting call operator on global variable X
  inner():Function entered
  inner():num: 500
  inner():Function leaving
  global():End of program


IDLE Log Coverage:
The IDLE log PDF demonstrates the same closure mechanics interactively, showing
that locals() within inner() contains {'num': 500}, confirming that the
enclosing variable is captured in the nested function's scope.

All code is correct, runs without errors, and produces the expected output.
No issues found.
